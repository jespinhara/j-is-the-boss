JBoss EAP/AS &lt;= 6.X Vulnerability by @joaomatosf - A little bit beyond ACED

This code exploits an unsafe deserialization affecting the JBoss EAP/AS <= 6.X by default and JBoss EAP/AS up to date if the targeted services are enabled (which now their are disabled by default).

Exploit in python should be less than 20 lines... :) I just like rust!
